Slack is a messaging app for teams. More organizations are using Slack for team collaboration as it is well crafted and consolidates notifications at one place. Slack brings all team communications together and provides a platform to integrate with various tools and services teams use everyday.  Slack makes the peopleâ€™s working lives simpler, more pleasant and more productive. 

Git is the most widely used version control system. Every change, from fixing a typo to a complete redesign of the software, is tracked and uniquely identified. Although Git has a complex set of commands and can be used for rather complex operations, learning to apply the basics requires only a handful of new concepts and commands and will provide a solid ground to efficiently track code and related content for research projects.

Earlier developers used to integrate a mailing list with their Git repositories. Whenever there is a new commit, they would get a new email. Slack completely changes the way git changes are tracked and notified. It provides a way to integrate at the application level. We can specify the repositories to monitor and select the channels that are linked to the updates. We can also select the events that trigger a message.
